# extract-email-from-text-python-3
Extract emails from text file.

This project is intended to be a brand new open source version of 
a basic codebase I've used for the better part of a decade to extract 
email addresses from data breaches.

Extraction follows a simple process:

-Extract all addresses via regex
-Convert them to lowercase
-Order them alphabetically
-Save them to an output file

This script is a property under https://t.me/+T1DGYYhQhco2ZmVk

It works with python 3
